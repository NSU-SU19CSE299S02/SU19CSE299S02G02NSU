<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<h3>Breif idea of the project:</h3>
<p>The main idea of our project is to make a three dimensional (3D) image scanner. We usually take 2D images from our mobile’s camera for day to day life. Our product is going to detect and scan the English and Bangla letters from the regular images. Then it’s going to convert the letters in 3D and also going to show their 3D models on screen. Users will be able to zoom in/out the images, rotate left to right or right to left for watching the image details. We are going to solve the simple images like letters first and then we will try to extend our project for any images of things for educational purpose.</p><br>

<p>The usual images that we see in the text books for educational purpose all them are in 2D. As a result, students don’t get the clear conception of things which are not as much available in real life. For example, biological organs which we see are in 2D form. If it’s possible to make those images in 3D then the students will be able to have clear concept over that. By this product education will be much more interesting and easy for the students.</p>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Going to take picture of 2D English or Bangla letter</li>
	<li>Going to convert the 2D image to 3D image</li>
	<li>Going to show the letter model of that particular latter into 3D</li>
	<li>Users will be able to rotate, zoom in/out the models for seeing the details</li>
</ul>


<h3>Technology:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Blender: For 3D modeling.</li>
	<li>Vuforia Engine:  For detecting and targeting image.</li>
	<li>Unity: For opening the 3D model in mobile’s camera.</li>
	<li>Paint 3D for creating 2D image for Bangla and English letters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monetization:</h3>
<p>We are going to create an option where the users will be able to purchase our product’s membership using their payment systems. Following payment methods will be included:</p><br>
<ul>
	<li>Bkash</li>
	<li>Rocket</li>
	<li>Ukash</li>
	<li>Upay</li>
	<li>Credit Card</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also try to implement AdMob Ad for monetization so that we can earn form AdSense account. We will be using 2 types of ad unit such as banner ad and video ad.</p>
